## Description
Add-In for Fusion 360 allowing quick generation of simple [gridfinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8) bins and baseplates. The created bodies are parametric and can be easily edited if needed before exporting. Bins have an option to be generated solid providing a kick start for specialized tool bins creation.

## Features

### Baseplates
- accepts amount of bases X and Y directions
- base measurement can be changed, default is 42mm
- there are options to generate thick plate with magnet or/and screw holes
- thick plate can be skeletonized to reduce weight, it also allows room for connection holes which can be customized to fit certain screw size or glue in pin
- size of magnet sockets and screw holes can be adjusted

#### Baseplate types
Light | Skeleton with connection holes | Full

### Bins
- accepts amount of bases X and Y directions
- base measurement can be changed, default is 42mm for base width and 7mm for the unit of height
- height is specified in base units, 1 unit will be added to the input to accomodate bin bottom
- generated bins can have a lip for better stackability or a straight wall
- lip can have notches preventing bins from sliding when stacked
- wall thickness can be adjusted
- magnet sockets can be customized to allow snug fit of the magnets, or a different size
- screw holes diameter can be adjusted
- when magnet and screw holes are enabled together, a groove will be generated to help with printability
- bin can be shelled with constant wall thickness to save printing time and filament
- label tab can be generated (length, offset and overhang angle are adjustable)
- allows generation of base or body separately, could be useful if need combine it with existing model
- compartments can be configured to use uniform scale
- custom compartmens layout is based on the uniform grid and allows merging multiple cells together, specifying custom depth and position

#### Bin bottom options
Solid bottom | With screw holes | With magnet cutouts | Combined

## Installation

### Step 1: Download

Download code into a location on your hard drive.
- Option 1: Clone git repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Le0Michine/FusionGridfinityGenerator.git
```
- Option 2: Download ZIP file
Use `Code / Download ZIP` option (or [click here to download the zip](https://github.com/Le0Michine/FusionGridfinityGenerator/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)) and unpack it into the target location

### Step 2: Install as Add-In to Fusion 360
- In Fusion open `Scripts and Add-Ins` window by pressing `Shift + S`.
  - It is also can be found in the UI `Design -> Utilities -> ADD-INS`
- Select `Add-Ins` tab and press `+` icon to add new add in
- Select path to the repository downloaded in Step 1. Choose the folder containing `GridfinityGenerator.py`.
- `GridfinityGenerator` should appear in the list of add ins
- Select `GridfinityGenerator` and click `Run` to launch the add in
- `Gridfinity bin` and `Gridfinity baseplate` options should appear in `Create` menu in the Solid body workspace environment

## Update

To update the script download latest sources into the same location and relaunch fusion.
